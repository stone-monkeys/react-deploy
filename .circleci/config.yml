# Orbs are a prepared package that contains reusable CircleCI config that can be used across projects
# Using the Herouku orb that has jobs such as heroku/deploy-via-git (line 13)
orbs:

# Workflow refers to a set of rules defining a collection of jobs and their run order.
# In this case the deployment will not be carried out unless our tests pass. We can
# also see that we have limited the job to our main branch. Our code will only 
# be deployed on changes to this branch
