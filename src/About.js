                        Hi! Iâ€™m Derry, and I'm a Solutions Engineer Working at CircleCI. In a previous life, I was a Software Engineer working with the Cloud Computing unit in Fidelity Investments. 
                        As an Under-Grad, I studied Geography(Urbanization) & Economics at Maynooth University.

                        Here I developed a strong interest in the application of technology in the urban realm, 
                        in particular its use in solving human-centric problems. 
                        My thesis sought to identify the extent in which digital platforms can be used in cities with regard to optimising the use of space, by enabling the 
                        efficient use of idle assets. I am very passionate about systems of interrelated devices that have the ability to transfer data over a network with no human intervention ie - IoT.
                        I am also very interested in learning and applying how The Cloud can pave the way for this data to travel.
                    </p>

                        I worked for the DevOps teams in the past and now @CircleCI, our aim was to build automated pipelines to create a seamless deployment process for our customers. 
                        In doing so, we enable Engineers to focus above the value line (What they deliver to their customers) and focus on the most complex aspects of the application.
                        I strive for best practice in my field and I am look forward to exploring how best practices in the DevOps space can be harnessed to implement revolutionary technolocial solutions.
